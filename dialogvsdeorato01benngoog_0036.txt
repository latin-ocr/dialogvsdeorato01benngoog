ego utrosque non in iudiciis modo studiose audiebam,
sed domi quoque et in publico adsectabar mira studio-

Thus he banished and afterwards
put to death Helvidius Priscus,
besides expelling the philosophers
of the Stoic and Cynic schools.-

a man of Gallie origin. He was
a friend of Quintilian, who in X.
