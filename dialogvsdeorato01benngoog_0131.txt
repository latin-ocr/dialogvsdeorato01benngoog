WHILE this book takes due account oi the literature which has

grown up about Horace, it is meant to be distinctly a study
of the poet himself, and is intended especially ior the college class·
room. The commentary assumes that the reader is at a somewhat
advanced period in his Latin studies. Matters oi grammatical
detail occupy therefore a very subordinate place-except sc iar
as Horace's Latinity marks an important stage in the development
oi the language, or is a conscious deviation for specific purposes
from the ordinary literary usages. On the other hand, the affort
is made to trace the motiva and sequence oi thought in each dis-
course and letter, and thus to emphasize Horace's reflectione upon

Roman society at one of its great turning-points, and to make clear ψ ι

the poet’s system oi conduct and life.

TEXT amnon. Paper. Introduction Pricawcents.

IN the Brutus, which was composed in 46 n.c. and purports to

be a conversation with Atticus and Brutus, Cicero traces the
development of oratory among the Romans down to his own time,
with critical notices oi about two hundred speakers. The long
catalogue is relieved of dryness by the dialogus form, the ireedom
oi digression, and by Cicero's fresh and teeming style.

Professor Kellogg has edited the work especially ior college read-
ing. The Introduction touches upon points oi interest to those to
whom Cicero is no stranger, and contains a full conspectus. The

notos deal with the subject-matter, historical relations, and diction '

oi the dialogus rather than with the commonplaces of grammar.

Parallel passages are ireely given, especially from Cicero’s other
rhetorical works and irom Quintilian.
