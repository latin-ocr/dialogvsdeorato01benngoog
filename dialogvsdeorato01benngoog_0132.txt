umes 01 Livy, one containing Books Ι. and lI., tho other Boolrs
XXI. and XXII. The first volume, which is now ready, has been
odited by Professor Greenough in accordance with his well-known
views on tho teaching 01 Latin. The 1001 that Livy is commonly

learning to read Latin -has been kept stoadily in view. Histori-
001 questions have been treated with sufficient iulness 101 intelligent

the presentation 01 Livy’s exact ideas in the form in which they

¹ lay in his mind, and in the precise order in which in their parts

and their totality ho intended 10 present them. The character 01
early Roman history and Livy's quality as 0 historiari, together
with his stylo and Latinity, aro treated in tho Introduction.
