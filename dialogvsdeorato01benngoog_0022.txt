INTRODUCTION. xvii

V11>srnwus Massaron was a born Roman and a de·
scendant of one of Rome's most illustrious families. He
was soldier, historian‚ and orator, winning his greatest
successes in the last-named field. His general position was
one of admiration for the past. He laments the prevailing
negligence on the part of parents in the education of the
young, has no sympathy with the schools of rhetoric, in which
the orator now gets his training for a forensic career, and
deplores the decline of taste, simplicity, and purity of style,
which have affected contemporary oratory.

Cumnrrvs Mn‘rrsmvus was also probably a Gaul by birth
and, like his countrymen‚ Aper and Secundus had first
devoted himself to a forensic career. With this pursuit he

abandon the forum and henceforth devote his attention to
the Muses. It is therefore as poet and idealist that Mater-

Aper. Wealth and influence have no charms for him. His
choice is rather the nemora et luci ct secretum (12. 1), the
. felix contubernium of the Muses (13. 1).

in distributing chapters 36-41. Some critics assign the entire
passage to Maternus; others put chapters 36-4o.1 in the
mouth of Secundus, assuming a lacuna before the words
non de otiosa ct quieta re leqm'mur in 40. 2, and allow
Maternus's closing remarks to begin at that point. This
latter view is plausible for two reasons :—

1. If we assign the entire passage from chapter 36 to the end
of chapter 41 to Maternus, we meet with numerous irrelevant
repetitions and inconsistencieS. Thus ii we attribute the
