Δ. Tne Minoscnrrrs

THE MSS. of the Dialogus are all descended from a single codex
supposed to have been written in the 13th century, and discovered about
1457 by one Enoch of Ascoli‚ a papal monk, probably at the monastery
of Hersfeld in Hesse. The MSS. fall into two families‚ usually desig-
nated by X and Y. To the X·class belong:

A Vaticanus 1862.

B Leidensis, the second hand of which is designated as b.

To the V family belong:

E Ottobonianus.

V Vindobonensis7rr.

C Farnesianus.

Δ Vaticanus 4498.

D Vaticanus 1518.

A few others of inferior value.

Till latelyscholars gave the preference to the Xclass, but the tendency
of recent study has been to recognize the worth of the V-family.
