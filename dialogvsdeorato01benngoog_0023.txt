language in 37. 9 f. plures tamea battus praeliatores bella quam
paxseruut. Similis eloquentiae euridiciu to Maternus, it is sur-
prising to find the same speaker in 40. 7 repeating sub-
stantially the same idea in a weakened torm : tulit siue dubia
valentiorem elequentiam, etc. So also 41. 6 quid (apres est)
uoluntariis accusationibus, crem tam rara et parce peccetur?
41. 5 qeeid multer aprtdpupulum curationibus? can hardly have
been spoken by the same person as iam uero cautiones adsi-
duae et elutum ius patentissimum quemque vexandi atque ipsa
inimicitiarum gloria, in 40. 1. But it we attribute the latter
passage to Secundus, and regard the tormer as Maternus's
rejoinder‚ all difficulty disappears

Again, it we attribute chapters 36 ff. to Maternus we find
him giving utterance to sentiments at variance with those
previously expressed by him in the course oi the discussion.
Thus the enthusiastic allusion to the influence oi the earlier
orators in 36. 5, lu' clientelis etiam exterarum nationum reduu-
dabaut, lios ituri iu praeiiueias magistratus reverebantur, lios
reuersi celebant, ltus et praeturae et consulatus uocare rtltru vide-
bantur, is inconsistent with the contempt of such honors
expressed in 13· 2, lieet t'llus certamina et pericula sua ad cutt-
sulatus evexerint.

2. Furthermore chapters 36-40. 1 accord excellently with
the character of Secundus as historian and antiquarian‚ in .
which he appears in the discussion. The chapters in
question are in the nature· of an historical re'sume of the
development and course of oratory at Rome.

We shall therefore do best to recognize Secundus as the
speaker in all that follows the lacuna at the beginning oi
chapter 36 as far as 40. 1 quas aratoribus faces admovebant.
Atthis point we must assume a second lacuna and assign
to Maternus the passage from 40. 2 (nau de otiosa etc.) to
the close of 41.
