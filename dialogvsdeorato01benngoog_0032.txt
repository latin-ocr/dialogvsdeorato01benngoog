'INTRODUCTIOM ¹xxvii

Aran’s D1onnssrorr (16-23). Aper first enters upon
a sophistical argument as to the meaning of the word
antiquus. He maintains that the term cannot properly
be applied to Cicero and his contemporaries; lor they are
separated from the present by less than the limit oi a human
life. The real antiqui oratores are Appius Claudius Cato,
Carbo, Galba, and the Gracchi. Cicero and his contem·
poraries belong rather to an intermediate era, - it anything,
nearer the present than the past. Moreover the character
ot oratory varies with the times, and no single type is
to be summarily condemned simply because it differs from
another. Men always idealize the past, and underestimate
the present. The new oratory really marks a great advance
upon what preceded. It is brilliant and elaborate in
style, whereas the earlier orators were dry and tedious. An
audience of to-day, declares Aper, would no longer tolerate
such speakers People now want something ornate and
striking—something to remember and talk about. CalvuS,
Brutus, Asinius, and Corvinus were all faulty, and even
Cicero, praised though he is by some, is worthy ot admira·
tion only in his latest speeches.

Mnssnmn's Expmnrrrou or rua Dncnruu or ORATonv
(2 4—3 5). Messalla, urged by Maternus to tulfill the promise
already given (in chapter 16), tirst defends the orators of the
Ciceronian era against the attacks of Aper, maintaining that
all were worthy oi praise, each in his way. Contemporary
oratory, on the other hand, he asserts, descends to mere-
tricious devices‚ and is unworthy oi respect. Reminded
again by Maternus that he had promised to set forth the
causes of the decline of eloquence, Messalla declares that
they are really very obvious, According to his view the
prime cause is neglect in the training of the young. F ormerly
the mother superintended personally the education oi her
sons Now these are given over to slaves and nurses.
