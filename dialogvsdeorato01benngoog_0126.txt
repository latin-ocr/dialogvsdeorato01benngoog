All who care to do so are invited to send ior a circular entitled “Some
Facts about a Latin Grammar,'’ which gives some interesting information
about the comparative standing and extent 01 000 01 this grammar. For
one thing, it shows that oi 011 places in New England having a population
oi 10‚000 or more, this grammar is used in the high schools 01 over 70 per
cent, including over ’14 per cent 01 the pupils. The preference 01 the
special preparatory schools is even more emphatic. For New York‚ a
series 01 letters from 011 the Protestant colleges is given-16 in number-
ol which 13 recommend Allan and Greenough; one each is ior two other
grammate, and one 10 divided in preference. Tho hest scholare in the rest
01 the country are oi the same opinion. ,
