Ι. AUTHORSHIP OF THE DIALOGUS.

As compared with the admitted works of Tacitus (the
Agricola, Germania, Irlistarus, and Annals), the Dialogus
unquestionably exhibits marked differences ol language and
style. This circumstance le'd scholars, as early as the time
of Beatus Rhenanus (1485-1547), to question the manu-
script testimony as to the Tacitean authorship ol the piece.
Rhenanus in spite of his suspicions published the Dialogus
(1519) under Tacitus’s name, but Justus Lipsius (1547-
1606), in his edition published at Antwerp in 1574, in-
fluenced by certain resemblances to the Institutio Oratarza,
boldly ascribed the work to Quintilian and published it
under the title: Fabii Quintiliani, ut uidetur, Dialogus,
Carnelz'a Tanta salsa inscriptus. In his third edition, how-
ever, published in 1585, Lipsius confessed his doubts as to
the propriety ot ascribing the work to Quintilian, maintain-
ing nevertheless as stoutly as ever that Tacitus could not
be the author.

Since Lipsius first launched the controversy upon the
learned world, over three hundred years ag0, the question
of the authorship of the Dialogus has been an almost
constant subject ol discussion. Lipsius's immediate suc-
cessors adopted in general his view as to the non-Tacitean
authorship of the piece. Some went further and attributed
it to Pliny the Younger, to Maternus, or even to Suetonius ;
while others adopted Lipsius's earlier view and ascribed
the work to Quintilian. Defenders of the Tacitean author· Α
