INTRODUCTION.

11. DRAMATic DATE OF THE DIALOGUE.

The time when the dialogue is represented as taking place,
was the latter half of 74 or the first half of 75 ΑΛ). This we
gather from 17. 3, where one of the speakers refers to the
sextam iam seluta huius principatus stationem quo Vespasianus
rem publicam struet, i.e., the sixth year of Vespasian's happy
reign. Vespasian was proclaimed Emperor at Alexandria
upon the rst of July, 69 no. Hence the sixth year of his reign
would fall between July 1, 74 and July 1, 75. This accords ⁸
also with the epithet which Tacitus applies to himself at the
time of the dialogue, iuoouis admodum (1. 1). This expres· ’
sion in contemporary writers designates an age somewhere
in the vicinity of twenty, varying from the eighteenth to the
twenty-third year, which agrees perfectly with the age of
Tacitus at the time of the dialogue. For he was probably
born in 55 or 56 no, and would accordingly have been
eighteen at the youngest, at the oldest not more than
twenty. Further confirmation of the date of the discus-
sion is found in the reference in chapter 37 of the Dialogus
to Mucianus, the well-known supporter of Vespasian, who
is mentioned as actively engaged in collecting materials for
an historical work which he had projected. But Mucianus
was probably no longer alive in 77, so that the discussion
must have taken place before that date.

111. DATE OF COMPOSITION AND PUBLICATION.

Itis more difficult to determine when the Dialogus was
composed and published. From the reference of the author
to himself as iuuenis admodum at the time of the discussion,
it is quite evident that some little time must have elapsed
between the discussion itself and the composition of the
piece. If we assume publication to have followed com-
