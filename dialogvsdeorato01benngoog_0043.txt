P. CORNELII TACITI

[6. 4·

5 optimum Ast se non hahere? lam kero qui togatorum

comitatus et egressus, quae in publico specieS, quae in
iudiciis veneratio, quod illud gaudium consurgendi
adsistendique inter tacentes et in unum conversos,
coire populum et circumfundi coram et accipere adfe-
6 ctum quemcumque orator induerit ! Vulgata dicentium
gaudia et imperitorum quoque oculis exposita percenseo ;
illa secretiora et tantum ipsis orantibus nota maiora
7 sunt: sive accuratam meditatamque profert orationem,
est quoddam sicut ipsius dictionis ita gaudii pondus et
constantia ; sive novam et recentem curam non sine

rerum omnium abundantia:
pleonastic‚- apparenti y a union of
two modes of expression, rerum
ominum alzmazna'a and surnma
abundantia.

5. togatorum: well-dressedciti-
zeus, as opposed to the tunicatus
populus or rabble mentioned in 7. 4,
—comitatus et egressus: these
words constitute a sort of hendi-
adys,-‘what throngs attend him
when he sets out from home! ’ See
11. 4, where Maternus replies to
this remark of Aper's. Note also
the employment of abstract nouns
in the plural‚—a characteristic
feature of Tacitean style; cf. 28.
8 educationibus ,¹ 28. 9 pravitatibus„
and see lntr, p. xix.— consur-
gendi: for surgendi. T his use of
consurgo does not appear till the

·- Augustan era, ag. Livy III. 71. 3.
' Cf. 38. 4 depacavcrat for pacaverat.
'·-coire populum et circum-

fundi coram, ete: note the
alliteration. 'l'he infinitives are
taken by some editors as exclam-
atory; but itis better to under-
stand quod gartdium (est) from the
preceding line, and to recognize a
change of construction from the
gerund ¹93}oe int. §neh incon·

cinnity, while rare in the Dialogus,
is peculiarly characteristic of Taci-
tus's later works. Note the cli·
max: ‘assemble, crowd into the
orator'swffireseiltff and even
follow him in his changing moods.’
The skillful speaker, like the skill·
ful actor, makes his audience share
his own emotions.

6. vulgata, well-known, further
explained by imperitorum . . .
exposita, as secretiora by tan-
tum . . . nota. The emphasis is
upon vulgata: ‘it's only well-known
pleasures that 1 am enumerating;
there are others less manifest, yet
much greaien’ — imperitorum

quoque here in the sense of vel
asin 39. 6.—dicentium, oranti-
bus: the substantive use of the
partic, as frequently in Tacitus;
see intr, p. xx. — illa: referring to
what follows.

7. meditatam, carqfullystudie&
meditatus is passive here, as always
in Tacitus, except Dial. 10. 10.-
profert: as subj. supply mator from
theprecedingorantibus-pondus
et constantia, wezplt and sub-
stance—novam et recentem:
