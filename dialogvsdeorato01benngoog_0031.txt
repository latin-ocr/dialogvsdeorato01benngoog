and his consequent neglect of oratory. Maternus replying
proposes that Secundus act as judge upon the relative merits
of poetry and eloquence. The latter declines.

Aeurr’s Duruwsu os Onnronv nuo Annarouuarrr or Ι
Poernv (5—10). Aper nevertheless declares that he will not
hesitate to condemn Maternus’s neglect of oratory‚ and
thereupon proceeds to expand upon the attractions of this
profession. Nothing, he declares, is more useful, nothing
more delightful‚ nothing more glorious than the career of the
orator. In proof of this he refers to his own forensic
triumphs, and points to the famq the wealth, and the power
of Eprius Marcellus and Vibius Crispus, men high in the
favor and counsels of the Emperor. Poetry, on the other
hand, brings no positive advantage, its triumphs afford
merely a passing pleasure‚ while the fame of even the
greatest poet is much inferior to that of a gifted orator.⁸
Aper closes with 'an exhortation to Maternus to abandon
poetry and devote himself to oratory‚ his earlier profession.

Marnnuus's Daseusa or Poaer (rr-13). Maternus
praises the retirement and tranquillity of the woods and
groves, the favorite haunt of poets, as compared with the
din and distractions of the city. He refers to the dignity
and glory always accorded poets in the past, and compares
Homer with Demosthenes, Vergil with Cicero. Let others,
he exclaims‚ enjoy the struggleS‚ and win the triumphs of
the forum. As for himself he prefers the companionship
of the Muses.

Eurinucu or Massaron (14-16). Messalla arrives, and
as he enters expresses regret at not having heard the
previous discussion. Replying to a remark of Aper's he
declares it ¹‘as his opinion that the age of real orators is
past. Asked by the others to give the reasons for this, he
is about to proceed when Aper interrupts him.
