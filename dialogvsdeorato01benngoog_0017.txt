Ι xii INTRODUCTION.

c. In Dial. 28-30 the writer touches upon the important
part formerly played by the mother in the training of
children, and with this decaying custom contrasts the
existing conditions by which children were often handed
over to nurses and worthless servants: 28. 5 nan in cella
emptae nutricis, sed in gremia ac sinu matris educabatur ,· 29. 1
at nunc natus infans delegatur Graeculae alicui ancillae, cui
adiungitur unus aut alter ex amnibus servis, plerumque
iratissimus. With these passages compare the following,
where the similarity of language as well as of thought is par-
ticularly striking: Agr.4 mater Iulia Procilla suit, rarae
castitatis. In breius sinn indulgentiaque educatus per amnem
honestarum artium cultum pueritiam adulescentiamque transegit ,·
Ger. 20 secu areamque mater uberibus alit, nec ancillis aut
nutricibus delegantur. ’

d. The characterizations of public men in the Dialogus
agree with the characterizations of the same men as found
in the Irbstarus and Annali. Thus in Dial. 5.7 Eprius
Marcellus is accinctus et minax‚· in Ann. XVI. ²9 taraus ac
minax‚· Him IV. 43 minacibus aculis. So also like judg-
ments are expressed concerning Vatinius in Dial. 11 and
Ann. XV. 343 concerning Pomponius Secundus in Dial.
13. 4 and Auri. XII. 28; concerning Vipstanus Messalla
in Diul. 15 and Irlrst. IV. 42; while the full account
given in Irbst. IV. 43 of the conflict in the Senate between
Helvidius Priscus and Eprius Marcellus reads like an
amplification of the allusion to the same event found in
Dial. 5.

e. It is a striking peculiarity of the Dialogus and Annals
that they both reckon the beginning oi Augustus’s reign
irom his first consulship in 43 uc, and not from the battle
of Actium, or from his assumption oi the title Augustus,
as do other writers.
