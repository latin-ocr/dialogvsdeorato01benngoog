THIS is offered as a thoroughly satisfactory manual for pre-

paratory sehools and colleges, and itis believed to combine
excellences of diverse kinds in such a way as to be the closest
possible approach to an ideal grammar.

1. This has always been regarded as the truest and soundest
of Latin grammar manuals. Instead of making arbitrary laws
and distinctions in order to secure an artificial clearness of state-
ment, this grammar has been faithful to the spirit and the facts
of the language. This is its fundamental excellence. The
grammar explains the language instead of trying to make the ,
language hear out the grammar. *¹

2. The present edition is as strong in class-room avallability
as it is for linguistic truth. Mr. George L. Kittredge, formerly
Instructor in Latin in Phillips Exeter Academyand'now Professor
of English at Harvard, was associate reviser, and largely on
account of his combining special qualifications in Latin and
in English, the style of the grammar was radically improved. lt
is believed to be now much olearer, more crisp and definite, more
interesting and learnable, than any other grammar.

3. Even in all the little points, the closest carc was taken in ·
the revision, and scarcely a book can he found in which the
excellence is so uniform and in which the finish reaches so faith-
fully to the minutest details.

4. ln a word, the consensus of competent opinion seems to
justify fully the belief that Allen and Greenough's Latin Gram-
mar is clearly the best: best for scholarship, convenience, com·
pleteness, aud bcanty, best for reference, and best for regular
study.
