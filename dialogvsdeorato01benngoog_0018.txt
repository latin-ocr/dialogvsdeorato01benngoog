INTRODUCTION. xiii

The above evidence may be brielly summarized as follows :
The MSS. are unanimous in ascribing the work to Tacitus ;
a comparison of diction, syntax, and style shows a number
af striking resemblances that can hardly be fortuitous;
while the general point oi view oi the writer of the Dialogus
andos the works admitted to have been written by Tacitus is
the same. Moreover, nothing inconsistent with the Tacitean
authorship oi the Dialogus can be advanced beyond the
discrepancy oi style. Both the dramatic date of the
dialogue itself and the probable date of composition and
publication tally perfectly with what we know oi Tacitus
Under these circumstances we may saiely accept the view
that Tacitus was the author.

As regards the difference in style between the Dialogus
and Tacitus’s later works we must consider not only the
difference in subject matter, but also the difference in time
of composition. The most probable date for the com-
position and publication oi the Dialogus is 81 nr). From
then until the publication of the Auuals in 115-117 Ar). was
aperiod oi over thirty years Between the Dialogus and the
Agricola (98 no.) seventeen years elapsed. Moreover the
period intervening between the composition of the two
works was occupied by the reign ol Domitian, the baneiul
character oi which had made the deepest impression upon
Tacitus Cf. Agr. 1 f. Under these circumstances, and
aiter so great a lapse of time, his style may well have taken
on a different character. Nor are such differences without
parallel in other writers. A similar development is notice-
able in Carlyle‚ and the difference between his Life of Schillor
and his Frederick tlte Groot has been aptly compared with
that between the Dialogus and the Annals.
