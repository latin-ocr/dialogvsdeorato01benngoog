position immediately, we can hardly place the composition
after 81 mn, the beginning of Domitian's reign, since the
contents of the work make it extremely doubtful whether its
author would have ventured upon publication under that
emperor. The close of Domitian's reign, 96 ab, would, on
the other hand, be out of the question, as it assumes the extra-
ordinary interval of twenty-one or twenty-two years between
the discussion and the composition. Moreover it brings the
Dialogus within two years of the Agricola (98 nn), and
makes it impossible to account for the striking difference of
style between these two productioris. It therefore seems
best to refer the composition of the Dialogus to the closing
year of Titus’s reign, 81 nm, 'seven years after the date of

· the discussion which it records. 1t has been objected that

this interval does not justify the use of the expression
iuvenis admodum as applied by the author to himself in
chapter 1. But if Tacitus was eighteen at the time of the
discussion, he was twenty-five when he wrote the Dialogus.
Moreover the intervening period had been an eventful one
for him. He had held various public offices, and in 78 nn.
he had married the daughter of Agricola. It is easy to
understand, therefore, that the maturity he had acquired in
the interim thoroughly justified him in referring to himself
seven years previously as iuvenis admodum.

IV. THE INTERLOCUTORS.

The participants in the discussion are four in number,
Marcus Aper, Julius Secundus, Vipstanus Messalla, and
Curiatius Maternus. The scene is laid at the house of
Maternus.

MARCUS APER was born in Gaul (cf. 10. 3 ne quid de
Gallis nostris loquar), but had early corne to Rome. Here
he devoted himself zealously to the study of eloquence, and
