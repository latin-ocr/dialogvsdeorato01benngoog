rat. Magna eloquentia, sicut flamma, materia alitur et
motibus excitatur et urendo clarescit. Eadem ratio in
nostra quoque civitate antiquorum eloquentiam pro· ·

consecuti sunt quae composita et quieta et beata re
publica tribui ias erat, tamen illa perturbatione ac
licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur, curn mixtis omni-

one should sacrifice one’s own
child in order to stay a pestilence,
etc-cum ad iudices ven-
tum: the sentence probably
closed with some such thought
as: ‘then we see how scant their
equipment is.' The conclusion of
Messalla's speech, and the begin·
ning of·the following are lost.
The lacuna was of several pages
in extent, six in one MS.

combination of Cicer0; cf. deHn.

such moderate distinction as it was
possible to attain under existing
conditions‚ implying that in a

well-ordered and tranquil gov-
emment such opportunities were
more restricted than formerly.—
illa: τῖε. under the Republic,
as opposed to horum temporum
above— plura sibi adsequi vi-
debantur: the thought is inac-
curately expressed. The earlier
Roman oratore, who must be un·
derstood as referred to in vide-
bantur, could obviously not have
compared themselves with a later
generatiou. as enjoying larger privi-
loges (plura adsequi). The writer
means rather: ‘secured greater
rewards, as it seems to me’ For
a similar use oi videri, ci. Caes.

—- omnibus: for omnibus rebus:
cf. 37. 4 leis. Neuter plural adjec-
tives are rarely used substan-
tlvely by earlier writers in any case
except the nom. or acc, where the
termination shows the gender. The
writers of the Silver Age, however,
employ the other cases with some
freedom, ag. Tac. Agr. 35 firmus
adversis; Seneca, de Bcnes. II. 5.
