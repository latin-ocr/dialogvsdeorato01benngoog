PREFACE.

-ψ-

In 1891 the editors-inchiet oi the College Series asked

me to prepare ior publication the manuscript notes on the

Dialogus leit by the late Professor Lucius Heritage ol
the University oi Wisconsin. Ι acceded totheir request,
expecting that my task would consist mainly in clerical ’
revision. An examination oi Mr. Heritage's manuscript,
however, showed that his edition differed materially in
scope from the other books ol the series3 moreover‚ since
its preparation in 1883-84, the progress ol critical study
on the Dialogus had been unusually rapid. Under these
circumstances it seemed necessary to recast the work
entirely, and Ι accordingly did so.

In the execution oi this taslr Ihave received important
help from Professor Alired Gudeman ol the University oi
Pennsylvanla‚ who generously put at my disposal the
exhaustive materials oi his forthcoming edition oi the
Dialogus, and who has also assisted me ireely in other

ways,
