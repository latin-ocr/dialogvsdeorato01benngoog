acquired fame as an orator and advocate, rising successively
to the offices of quaestor, tribune, and praetor. In the
Dialogus he appears in a double rdle. Against Maternus he
defends the attractions of his chosen profession as compared
with those of poetry, while against Messallahe defends the
claims of contemporary oratory as compared with that of
earlier days, ln style he is represented as bold, enthusiastic,
prone to exaggeration, and' inclined to rely upon his natural
endowments rather than upon profundity of learning.
Occasionally he stoops to sophistry, as in his remarks
upon the meaning of the term antiquus in ch. 16 ff. In
a word he represents the practical and useful, his general
attitude being well embodied in his own language (5. 5)

Juarus SECUNDUS, like Aper, was bom in Gaul, and like
, him had come to Rome and devoted himself to oratory.

In other respects the two men present the strongest con-
trast. Secundus was modest and retiring ; he lacked Aper's
aggressiveness, and apparently never held public office. As
a speaker he was deficient in fire and spontaneity, and was
distinguished rather for the purity of his diction and the
polish of his style. Hence many criticised him as lacking
inpromptus sermo (2. 3), and even his friend Quintilian, who
speaks of him as mirae facundiae vt'rum, nevertheless ex·
presses regret that he was not multa magri pugnax. Secun-
dus’s forte evidently was composition rather than delivery.
Hence he had naturally devoted himself to historical writing‚
and had already won favorable comment for his Life ry
Julius Africanus (14. 5). Quite consistent too with this is
the tone of chapters 36-40. 1, which are best referred to
Secundus. This entire passage, with its historical detail
and references to sources exactly fits the character of the
historian Secundus,
