P. CORNELII TACITI

[u. a

Epicuri quidem et Metrodori honestas quasdam exclama-
tiones adsumere iisque prout res poscit uti alienum erit
10 oratori. Neque enim sapientem informamus neque Stoi-
corum comitem, sed eum qui quasdam artes haurire,
omnes libare debet. Ideoque et iuris civilis scientiam
veteres oratores comprehendebant, et grammatica musica
11 geometria imbuebantur: incidunt enim causae, plurimae
quidem ac paene omneS, in quibus iuris notitia desi-
deratur, pleraeque autem, in quibus haec quoque scientia
32 requiritur. Nec quisquam respondeat sufficere ut ad
2 tempus simplex quiddam, et uniforme doceamur. Pri:
mum enim aliter utimur propriis, aliter commodatis,

phon’s style hasbeen recognized
in all ages3 cf. Quint. X. 1. 28q1aa
ega commemorem Xenophontis iu·
cunditatem inaffectatam ,9- Metro·
dori: of Lampsacus, anillustrious
disciple oi Epicurus. Cicero, de
Fin. II. 92, calls him paene alter
Epicurus. —honestas quasdam:
implying that in the main the doc-
trines of this school were not such
as a worthy man might avail him·
seli of. — exclamationes: short,
pithy expressions in which Epi-
curus and his disciples were fond
oi embodying their tenets‚ eg. is
maxime divitiis fruitur qui minime
divitiis indiget, Sen. Ep. 14. 17.-
poscit: the present ior the future
as occasionally in the Latin of all
periods.

10. neque enim: supply in
sense: ‘This eclectic method of
procedure is justifiable.’- sapien-
tem: i.c. an ideal philosopher. -
Stoicorum comitem, a sollower
os tlce Stoics. According to Mes-
salla, it is enough for the orator,
without being a man of perfect
wisdom (sapientem), or without
adhering to a single system of phi-
losophy, as cg. the Stoic, to take

from the different systems what·
ever may serve his purpose.—
haurire, libare: ie. to study some
branches exhaustively and to dip
into others3 cf. our ‘Know every·
thing about something, and some·
thing about everything.’

11. incidunt . .. desideratur: log-
ically subordinate to pleraeque. ..
requiritur, though grammatically
coordinate. The thought is: ‘For
while there are many cases-most,
in fact- in which a knowledge of
civil law is necessary, yet many
occur in which a knowledge of
these other branches (grammar,
music, geometry) is also essential'
-haecscientim achaemeniam
(grammaticae, musicae, geometriae)
scicrctia; cf. Cic. de Or. Ι. 10 ei
scientiae, ie. eins artis (mathema-
ticae) scientiar.

32. nec: for neu; as in 13.8
and frequently—ut ad tempuS,
etc: ie. secure some simple and
elementary instruction in a subject
according to one’s temporary need.
—uniforme, simple, a synonpm of
simplex. The word is not ound
elsewhere except in much later
writers.
