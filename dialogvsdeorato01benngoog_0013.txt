ship were rare ior over two hundred years aiter Lipsius’s
third edition. It was not until the beginning ot the present ·
century that a decided reaction set in in lavor of Tacitus,
Since that time the evidence that the Dialogus is his work
has gradually been more and more fully presented, and
more and more generally accepted as valid. Few scholars
today deny Tacitus's title to the authorship.

The grounds on which the Tacitean authorship rests are
as follows :—

1. The MSS. attribute the work to Tacitus. When we
consider that the Dialogus is found almost exclusively in
MSS. which contain the Germania also, it will be seen

· that the weight ot this argument is considerable.

2. Although in general the contrast in diction and style
between the Dialogus and the acknowledged writings of
Tacitus is great, yet a careful examination reveals striking
evidences oi a common authorship, and even enables us to
trace the genetic development of Tacitus’s style froin the
Dialogus (his earliest work) to the Annals (his latest).
