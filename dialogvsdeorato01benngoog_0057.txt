-la 2] DIALOGVS DE ORATORIBVS. 23

Plures hodie reperies qui Ciceronis gloriam quam qui 7
Vergilii detrectent, nec ullus Asinii aut Messallae liber
tarn inlustris est quam Medea Ovidii aut Varii Thyestes.

Ac ne fortunam quidem vatum et illud felii< contu· 13

bernium comparare timuerim cum inquieta et anilia'

oratorum vita. Licet illos certamina et pericula sua 2
ad consulatus evexerint, malo securum et quietum
Vergilii secessum, in quo tamen neque apud divum

7. Ciceronis, etc: Homer and et condidus et quodam modo prae-
Demosthenes, the greatest poet ferens iu dicendo nobilitatem suam,
and orator of the Greeks, are viribus asinar—liber: ie. apub·
compared with Vergil and Cicero, lished speech, as often in the
the greatest literary representa· Dialogus. The usage is post-
tives of the Romans ; so Euripi· Augustam-Medea Ovidii aut
des and Sophocles, Lysias and Varii Thyestes: Quintilian, X.
Hyperides, writers of less eminence 1. 98, speaks briefly of both these
from Maternus's point of view, are dramas‚ which were extant in his
compared with Roman authors of day, but have since disappeared:
corresponding grado-Vergilii Varii Thyestes cuilibet Graecarum
detrectent:cf. Donatus Vita Verg. comparari potest, Ovidii Medea
43 obtrectatores Wrgr'lt'onuntqream ur'detur milri ostendere quantuni
defuerunt—Asinii: C. Asinius ille uir praestare potnerit, si in-
Pollio, the friend and patron of genio suo imperare quam indulgere
Vergil. He served in the Civil maluisset—Varii: L. Varius Ru·
War, and was subsequently con· fus, noted as an epic and tragic
sul, but soon afterwards withdrew poet. He was a friend of Vergil
from public life and devoted him· and Horace. The latterfrequently

self to literary pursuits, oratory‚
history, and poetry‚ in all of which
he gained distinction. He origin-
ated the custom of public recita-
tions of new literary productions.
See 9. on. Vergil’s fourth Ec·
logue is addressed to him, and his
praises are also sung by Horace
Odes 11. 1; cf. also Quint. X. 1.
113 multa in Asinio Pollione in-
ventio, summa diligentia—Mes-
salla: M. Valerius Messalla Cor-
vinus; he fought on the side of
Brutus and Cassius at Philippi,
but later attached himself to Octa-
vianus, by whom he was honored
with various public offices; cf.
Quint. X. 1.113 Messalla nsndus

speaks of him, ag. in Sat. l. 5. 40
Plotius et Varius Sinuessae Ver·
giliusque occurrunt, animae quales
non candidiores terra tulit.

13. ne fortunam quidem: cf.
chapter 9, where Aper pictures in
glowing colors the good fortune
of the oraton-contubernium:
here probably of communion with
nature or the Muses; cf. 6, and
for the figurative use of contu·
bernium see 5. 2n.

2. licet evexerint: concessive.
—Vergilii secessum: according
to tradition Vergil in his last years
retired to a villa near Naples on
the Hill of Posilipo, where his
tombis still pointed out.
