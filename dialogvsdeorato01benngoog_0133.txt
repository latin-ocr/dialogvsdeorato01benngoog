THE text oi this edition has been prepared with particular care,
mainly on the authority of the two best codices, G and Ο, the

latter having been collated by the editor himself at Oxsord in the ¹

summer oi 1889 by the courtesy oi the Librarian of the Bodleian.
The work is turnished with an introduction, in which the poet's
liie and character, his relations with his contemporaries, his liter-
ary activity, and the manuscript traditione oi his poema are fully
treated, and an exposition oi his metrcs is given. The Appendix
contains a complete collation oi G and 0, and a reduced fac-
simile oi apage of the latter codex, reduced one-third in siae,
forms the frontispiece of the volume. There are two indexes,

one oi the proper names mentioned in the introduction or in the
text3 the other, of the matters treated iu the notes.
