In earlier days too it used to be the custom for a young
man preparing for the oratorical profession to attach himself
to some jurist or advocate, to follow him ilpy by day, in
court and before the people‚ and thus leam his profession

by practical experience. Today, complains W
the fashion to declaim suasoriae and controv iae e
school of some rhetor, — with results that are too well k

to require further comment. (The speech breaks off in a
lacuna.)

Sucuunus’s Sanncrr (36—40, 1.-The first part of the
speech is lost in the lacuna). Secundus gives an historical
review of the causes leading to the development of oratory
at Rome, viz. the strife of parties and the general political
restlessness which agitated the state. Oratory was favored
too by the mode of procedure in the courts. Liberal time
used to be afforded for speaking, and the number of counsel
was not limited‚ whereas to-day every sort of restriction and
impediment confronts the advocate. (The speech breaks
off in a lacuna.)

Mm'anuus’s Crosruc Sruncrr (40. 2to end).-The first
part is lost, Referring to Secundus’s last remarks, Maternus
shows from them that eloquence is the child of discord‚
turbulence, and violence, that its existence is consequently
an index of unsettled political conditions and defective
government. Why, therefore, should we deplore its deca·
dence? Let us enjoy the advantages of our own time,
· and not regret the lack of what we do not need.
